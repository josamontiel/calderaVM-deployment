# Caldera deployment to Azure VMs

This guide will be built as I figure out what I am doing, this is my firt time trying to do this. It will be divided into a few parts (so far)

## Table of Contents
1. Deploying the VM
2. Connecting VM to Sentinel (SIEM)
3. Installing Caldera
4. Using as a training tool for new SOC analysts


### Deploying the VM
VM deployment via Azure. It will likely start with One manual deployment, and work its way up to automated ad hoc deployments.

### Connecting VM to Sentinel (SIEM)
This will be to ingest logs for analysis and triage. 

### Installing Caldera
[Caldera](https://github.com/mitre/caldera) is an Automated Adversary Emulation Platform, this will be used to simulate real attacks.

### Using as a training tool for new SOC analysts
The end game is to be able to use this to train your SOC analysts using a "compromised machine" from detection through remediation.
